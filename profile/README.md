Community driven health monitoring of forests to support reforestration and maintaining a healthy natural ecosystem.

# Description

Many forest owners invested in the reforestration of their forests that became necessary by the consequences of the global climate change. Due to the size of the forest areas, however, many owners are unable to keep an eye on all reforestation projects and identify damage at an early stage. Carefully planned investments in the future of the forest can be destroyed by animals, prolonged drought or vandalism. If changes can be recognized at an early stage, further damage can be avoided in order to ensure sustainable development.
With Waldwatch, all visitors to the forest can support the reforestation by documenting photos and messages. The photos are made available anonymously to the forest owners so that they have a better overall impression of their forest.
